# Tool Spotlight: dirsearch ðŸš€ðŸ”Ž

If youâ€™re a penetration tester, bug bounty hunter, or just someone fascinated by how the web works behind the scenes, **dirsearch** is a tool worth knowing. This open-source project helps you uncover hidden files and directories on web servers, revealing potential security issues or interesting endpoints to explore.

In this **Tool Spotlight**, weâ€™ll cover what **dirsearch** is, why itâ€™s useful, and how to get started using it.

## What is dirsearch?

[**dirsearch**](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch) is a command-line tool built in Python that performs **directory scanning** against websites and web servers. By systematically going through a list of potential paths (often from a wordlist), it identifies directories, files, or endpoints that might otherwise remain hidden.

Common use cases include:

- **Penetration testing:** Finding hidden admin panels, test pages, or backup files that might reveal vulnerabilities.
- **Bug bounty hunting:** Discovering lesser-known endpoints on large web applications can lead to new bug bounty submissions.
- **Website analysis:** If you suspect your site (or any site) has leftover files or directories, **dirsearch** can help you confirm.

## Why Use dirsearch?

1. **Fast and Efficient**: With threaded scanning and multiple request methods, **dirsearch** can quickly probe numerous endpoints.
2. **Highly Customizable**: From custom wordlists to extension-based scanning, you can tailor **dirsearch** to fit any target or scenario.
3. **Open Source**: Its code is openly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch), making it easy to review, contribute, and modify.
4. **Active Community**: A popular choice among security professionals, **dirsearch** enjoys continuous updates and community support.

## Key Features

- **Multithreading** for quicker results.
- Support for **multiple protocols** (HTTP, HTTPS).
- **Recursive scanning** to dig deeper into subdirectories.
- Automatic **logging** and **reporting**.
- **Proxy integration** (e.g., for anonymity or capturing requests in Burp Suite).
- Flexible **HTTP method** usage (GET, POST, HEAD, etc.).

## Getting Started

### Installation
**Requirement: python 3.9 or higher**

Choose one of these installation options:

- Install with **git**: `git clone https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch.git --depth 1` (**RECOMMENDED**)
- Install with ZIP file: [Download here](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch/archive/master.zip)
- Install with Docker: `docker build -t "dirsearch:v0.4.3" .` (more information can be found [here](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch#support-docker))
- Install with PyPi: `pip3 install dirsearch` or `pip install dirsearch`
- Install with Kali Linux: `sudo apt-get install dirsearch` (deprecated)


    

Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™re all set.

### Basic Usage

The most straightforward way to run **dirsearch** is by specifying the target URL and a wordlist:

```bash
python3 dirsearch.py -u https://example.com -e php,asp,txt -w /path/to/your/wordlist.txt
```

Hereâ€™s what each flag does:

- `-u`: The target URL (e.g., [https://example.com](https://example.com)).
- `-e`: File extensions to look for (comma-separated).
- `-w`: Path to the wordlist that **dirsearch** will iterate through.

### More Examples

1. **Multithreading**
    
    ```bash
    python3 dirsearch.py -u https://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 50
    ```
    
    - `-t` specifies the number of threads. A higher thread count can speed up scans but also increase the load on the target server.
2. **Proxy Integration**
    
    ```bash
    python3 dirsearch.py -u https://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ```
    
    - Use this option if you want to intercept requests in a tool like Burp Suite.
3. **Ignoring Status Codes**
    
    ```bash
    python3 dirsearch.py -u https://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt --exclude-status=404,403
    ```
    
    - You can filter out certain HTTP responses to reduce noise.
4. **Recursive Scanning**
    
    ```bash
    python3 dirsearch.py -u https://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt --recursive
    ```
    
    - When **dirsearch** finds a directory, it will keep scanning within that directory.

## Best Practices and Tips

1. **Use Relevant Wordlists**: There are plenty of publicly available wordlists (e.g., [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)) containing common endpoints and filenames.
2. **Start Small, Then Go Big**: Before launching large scans, start with a smaller wordlist to identify potential leads. This can save time and reduce server load.
3. **Monitor Rate-Limits**: Some servers will block you if they detect too many requests. Adjust threading and be mindful of your scanning behavior.
4. **Stay Ethical**: Always have **proper authorization** before scanning a domain. Abiding by rules and respecting privacy are essential in cybersecurity.

## Conclusion

**dirsearch** is a powerful asset in the arsenal of any security researcher or developer aiming to discover hidden web assets. Its speed, flexibility, and open-source nature make it a go-to tool for reconnaissance and vulnerability assessments. By harnessing well-chosen wordlists, using proxy integrations, and tuning your scan settings, youâ€™ll be well on your way to unearthing the secrets concealed within web servers.
