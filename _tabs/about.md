# About Me: Zer0F8th

I’m **Zer0F8th**, a cybersecurity professional with a Master’s degree in Cyber Security. My work centers on **transmission systems** supporting critical infrastructure—from **SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)** networks to **data historian** solutions. In these environments, every vulnerability has the potential to disrupt vital operations, so I focus on proactive defense and rigorous testing to keep systems secure.

Beyond my day-to-day responsibilities in the **ICS/SCADA** domain, I’m an enthusiastic **bug bounty hunter** and **CTF** competitor. I find that constantly challenging my skills—through real-world bug bounty programs or capture-the-flag events—keeps me sharp and broadens my perspective on emerging threats and exploitation techniques. Whether I’m reverse-engineering a protocol or testing a new security tool, my approach is always hands-on and methodical.

On this blog, I’ll be sharing:
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Real scenarios, challenges, and solutions I encounter in transmission systems and critical infra security.
- **Research & Tools**: My explorations in vulnerability testing, hacking methodologies, and open-source security resources.
- **Reflections & Lessons Learned**: Insights from CTFs, bug bounty hunts, and the day-to-day realities of safeguarding industrial networks.

If you share an interest in ICS security, critical infrastructure protection, or just love talking shop about vulnerabilities, feel free to reach out. I’m always looking to connect with others in the security community—because collaboration is key in staying ahead of evolving threats.
